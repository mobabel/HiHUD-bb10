BlackBerry 10 Cascades Bluetooth OBD 2

## Overview

This project is developed for read On-Board-Diagnose data from bluetooth OBD device, such as Vehicle speed etc. 

I have compiled this project in one BB10 Dev Alpha phone, but it does not work as expected. BB10 Phone can not connect with my OBD device via bluetooth.

Reason not found. If anyone modify the code and read OBD data successfully, please share code.
